Read nytimes, medium ... articles 

Sites like nytimes and medium put a limit on free articles you can read in a month.
But if you dig slightly deeper, you can still see the article content in text format (via view source in html).
With a simple linux command line, you are prompted by the url of the page.
Paste the article ur, and voila!!! you have your free article.
