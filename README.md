Read nytimes, medium ... articles 

Sites like nytimes and medium put a limit on free articles you can read in a month.

But if you dig slightly deeper, you can still see the article content in text format (via view source in html).

Copy the linux command line (see file: codetopaste), and paste it in your linux terminal.

You are prompted by the url of the page.

Paste the article url. Hit enter and voila!!! you have your free article.

This assume python module 'requests' is installed.
